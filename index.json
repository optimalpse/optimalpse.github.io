Depending on the effort required to develop accurate models, it might be more efficient to jump the model-building step. Instead, we can use derivative-free optimization (DFO) - also known as black-box or \u0026#39;data-driven\u0026#39; optimization - for optimal controller tuning, reactor design, experiment design, or flowsheet design based purely on input-output evaluations. This would for example involve the use of Bayesian optimization or trust region methods to iteratively construct and optimize surrogates of the system\u0026#39;s input-output evaluations. Rather than use black-box optimization to optimize physical systems or simulations, we can solve complex coordination problems where the black-box evaluations involve optimization problems themselves. The holy grail of process systems operations would be to integrate all decision-making units that arise in the interaction between supply chain players and their hierarchical levels of decision-making. To this end, we can use DFO to determine the coordinating \u0026#39;complicating\u0026#39; variables in value chain and multi-level hierarchical planning-scheduling-control problems, otherwise determined by heuristics, decomposition techniques, or distributed optimization.

However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, we introduced the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. This concept is best illustrated visually as per the attached figures, where the performance of a controller around two possible set-points is compared: the global optimum (scenario 1 in blue) and the adversarially robust optimum (scenario 2 in red). We observe that, paradoxically, operating at the adversarially robust optimum yields a 30% larger mean objective value compared to operating at the global optimum due to its inherent robustness.

Finding synthesis pathways from potential reactants towards the molecule or product of interest is challenging. Traditionally, expert chemists use their own intuition to find potential disconnection sites in the product molecule to arrive at one or more reactant intermediates. These intermediates are subject to further inspection to finally arrive at reactants (building blocks) that can be purchased off-shelf. The iterative process from the molecular product to building blocks is formally known as retrosynthesis. To aid scientists in this endeavor, researchers have proposed a variety of computational tools based on heuristics, reaction rules, or data-driven approaches. Within recent years, machine learning (ML) has received tremendous attention for retrosynthesis. While ML algorithms are seen to be successful at proposing viable synthesis routes towards simpler molecules, there are many remaining challenges until these techniques will have a significant impact on molecular synthesis and discovery.

Unlike traditional centralized optimization methods, MARL allows for the consideration of local objectives and constraints of individual agents, leading to more realistic and effective solutions in dynamic and uncertain environments. In the chemical sector, supply chain optimisation is important due to the inherent complexities and risks associated with handling and transporting hazardous materials. MARL can be particularly beneficial in this context by enabling agents, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, to coordinate and optimize their operations collaboratively. This can lead to improved inventory management, reduced costs, and enhanced safety and compliance measures, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and competitive chemical supply chains.

Recent advancements in high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning have notably improved experimental procedures. While Bayesian optimization (BO) has undeniably revolutionized the landscape of optimization in experimental design, especially in the chemical domain, it's important to recognize the role of other surrogate-based approaches within conventional chemistry optimization problems. This is particularly relevant because many chemical problems involve mixed-variable design space with physical constraints, making it challenging for conventional BO approaches to obtain feasible samples during the acquisition step while maintaining exploration capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating mixed-integer optimization strategies is one way to address these challenges effectively. Specifically, we propose the utilization of mixed-integer surrogates and acquisition functions--methods that offer inherent compatibility with problems with discrete and mixed-variable design space. This work focuses on Piecewise Affine Surrogate-based optimization (PWAS), a surrogate model capable of handling mixed-variable problems subject to linear constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in optimizing experimental planning through three case studies, each with a different design space size and numerical complexity: i) optimization of reaction conditions for Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura cross-coupling (fully categorical), ii) optimization of crossed-barrel design to augment mechanical toughness (mixed-integer), and iii) solvent design for enhanced Menschutkin reaction kinetics (mixed-integer and categorical with linear constraints). By benchmarking PWAS against state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms and BO variants, we offer insights into the practical applicability of mixed-integer surrogates.","tags":["Bayesian optimization","Design of Experiment","MILP","mixed-variable","surrogate-based optimization"],"title":"Discrete and mixed-variable experimental design with surrogate-based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Tom Savage","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057361,"objectID":"0bfef5819af7cdd4fa106ee3908668e8","permalink":"https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/publication/savage-human-algorithm-2024-1/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:01.337168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-human-algorithm-2024-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian optimization has been successfully applied throughout Chemical Engineering for the optimization of functions that are expensive-to-evaluate, or where gradients are not easily obtainable.

To address this, in this paper, we present the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization (ARO) solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. To validate our claims, we present three case studies: an illustrative example, a bioreactor case study, and a multi-loop evaporator process. The proposed approach is found to improve RTO objectives, such as profit, by as much as $50%$ in some case studies compared to RTO formulations which ignore the performance of the control layers.","tags":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control"],"title":"ARRTOC: Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prodromos Daoutidis","Jay H.

With an emphasis on user-friendly design, we aim to streamline accessibility and facilitate utilisation within the research community. Additionally, we suggest and perform a new interpretability study to uncover the degree of chemical understanding acquired by retrosynthesis models. Our results reveal that frameworks based on chemical reaction rules yield the most diverse, chemically valid, and feasible reactions, whereas purely data-driven frameworks suffer from unfeasible and invalid predictions. The interpretability study emphasises that incorporating reaction rules not only enhances model performance but also improves interpretability. For simple molecules, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks identify relevant functional groups within the product molecule, providing thermodynamic stabilisation over the reactant precursors. In contrast, the popular Transformer fails to identify such crucial stabilisation. As the molecule and reaction mechanism grow more complex, both data-driven models propose unfeasible disconnections without offering a chemical rationale.

We demonstrate a step-by-step workflow to find a tractable solution to a tri-level formulation of a multi-site, multi-product planning-scheduling-control case study. We discuss solution tractability-accuracy trade-offs and scaling properties for both methods. Despite individual improvements over conventional heuristics, both approaches present drawbacks. Consequently, we synthesize our findings into a methodology combining their strengths. Our approach remains agnostic to the level-specific formulations when the linking variables are identified and retains the heuristic sequential solution as fallback option.

The inventory management problem is a well-known planning problem in operations research, concerned with finding the optimal re-order policy for nodes in a supply chain. While many centralized solutions to the problem exist, they are not applicable to real-world supply chains made up of independent entities. The problem can however be naturally decomposed into sub-problems, each associated with an independent entity, turning it into a multi-agent system. Therefore, a decentralized data-driven solution to inventory management problems using multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed where each entity is controlled by an agent. Three multi-agent variations of the proximal policy optimization algorithm are investigated through simulations of different supply chain networks and levels of uncertainty. The centralized training decentralized execution framework is deployed, which relies on offline centralization during simulation-based policy identification, but enables decentralization when the policies are deployed online to the real system. Results show that using multi-agent proximal policy optimization with a centralized critic leads to performance very close to that of a centralized data-driven solution and outperforms a distributed model-based solution in most cases while respecting the information constraints of the system.","tags":["Computer Science - Machine Learning","Computer Science - Multiagent Systems","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control"],"title":"An Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Inventory Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Zhengang Zhong","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057362,"objectID":"87937221221712d762d760da4bbcc928","permalink":"https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/publication/zhong-efficient-2023/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:02.719893Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-efficient-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a distributionally robust data-driven model predictive control (MPC) framework for discrete-time linear systems with additive disturbances, while assuming the distribution is only partially known through samples.

As a result, mobility considerations are becoming increasingly important in energy systems planning, particularly to achieve energy access in developing countries. Advanced ‚ÄúPlug and Play‚Äù control strategies have been recently developed with such a decentralized framework in mind, allowing easier interconnection of nomadic communities, both to each other and to the main grid. Considering the above, the design and planning strategy of a mobile multi-energy supply system for a nomadic community is investigated in this work. Motivated by the scale and dimensionality of the associated uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables over the 30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Flexibility Analysis is implemented for the design and planning problem. DRL based solutions are benchmarked against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected performance under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in Mongolia suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the degree of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor. Additionally, the DRL based policies lead to the development of dynamic evolution and adaptability strategies, which can be used by the targeted communities under a very wide range of potential scenarios. Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such as Cost, Equivalent Emissions and Total Unmet Load are measured, suggesting potential improvements compared to available baselines of up to 25%, 67% and 76%, respectively. Finally, the decomposition of values of flexibility and plug and play operation is presented using a variation of real options theory, with important implications for both nomadic communities and policymakers focused on enabling their energy access.","tags":["Deep Reinforcement Learning","Energy Systems Design","Flexibility in Design","Mobile Micro-Grids Systems","Real Options Analysis","Uncertainty and Risk Analysis"],"title":"Design and planning of flexible mobile Micro-Grids using Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bovinille Anye Cho","Jos√© √Ångel Moreno-Cabezuelo","Lauren A.

Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise.

When the number of gas analyzers in such CCS units is limited, variations in the load of the power plant pose a challenge to determine the gaseous CO2 concentration profile in the absorber. A dynamic hybrid model for estimating the carbon capture absorber‚Äôs gaseous CO2 concentration profile has been proposed in this study. The model is built using actual process data collected from a carbon capture pilot plant and it combines data-driven and reaction kinetic (mechanistic) modeling approaches to act as a soft sensor along the absorber column. A subset of the process data is used for training the data-driven models and for estimating the parameters of the mechanistic model respectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the data-driven model to reduce the input size and hence the size of the dynamic model elements. The outputs of the two models are fused by comparing the computed covariance matrices. A particular challenge for this work is that the collected process data has missing spatial labels and temporal values for the CO2 concentration measurements. The presented models are obtained using an encoding and interpolation approach for the missing information. For comparison, an alternative approach based on semi-supervised learning has been implemented. The performance of the resulting soft sensors is verified by using process data from previously unseen operating conditions. The soft sensor based on the proposed hybrid model outperforms the soft sensor trained by semi-supervised autoencoder. Overall the results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the CO2 concentration percentage with an average root mean squared error of 0.123.","tags":["Carbon capture pilot plant","Data-driven modeling","Long short term memory","Soft sensor"],"title":"A hybrid data-driven and mechanistic model soft sensor for estimating CO2 concentrations for a carbon capture pilot plant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ilya Orson Sandoval","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"3714898b5ad3f9db5a1280364eade5f1","permalink":"https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.964168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous time dynamical systems with neural networks.

The use of DGPs provides an end-to-end model for five discrete mesh fidelities, enabling less computational effort to gain good solutions during optimization. The accuracy of simulations for these five fidelities is determined against experimental data obtained from a 3D printed reactor configuration, providing insights into appropriate hyper-parameters.

When comparing different process designs, for the comparison to be meaningful, each design must involve its optimal operation. Therefore, to optimize a process‚Äô design, one must address design and control simultaneously. For this, one can formulate a bilevel optimization problem, with the design as the outer problem in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and a stochastic optimal control as the inner problem. This is intractable by most approaches. In this paper we propose to compute the optimal control using reinforcement learning, and then embed this controller into the design problem. This allows to decouple the solution procedure, while having the same optimal result as if solving the bilevel problem. The approach is tested in two case studies and the performance of the controller is evaluated.

One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability ‚Äî which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability.

However when small quantities of historical data are available, for example in novel processes, neural networks tend to over-fit to data providing poor performance. In this paper Gaussian processes are used as a method of function approximation to describe the action-value function of a non-isothermal semi-batch reactor. Through the use of analytical uncertainty obtained from Gaussian process predictions, trade off between exploration and exploitation is enabled, allowing for efficient generation of effective policies. Importantly Gaussian processes also enable probabilistic constraint violation to be modelled, ensuring safe constraint satisfaction throughout the learning procedure.

One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.","tags":["biomass cultivation","culture mixing","light/dark cycle","multiscale kinetic modelling","photobioreactor design"],"title":"Synergising biomass growth kinetics and transport mechanisms to simulate light/dark cycle effects on photo-production systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Tom Savage","Hector Fernando Almeida-Trasvina","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Robin Smith","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684323406,"objectID":"5fb99e51fb2131ed1fb3542d2a849b51","permalink":"https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/publication/savage-202073/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:46.430167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-202073/","section":"publication","summary":"Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques.

To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint.

However, bioprocesses are generally operated at unsteady-state conditions and are stochastic from a macro-scale perspective, making their optimisation a challenging task. Furthermore, as biological systems are highly complex, plant-model mismatch is usually present. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based online optimisation strategy. We first use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy given a preliminary process model. This means that we compute diverse trajectories and feed them into a recurrent neural network, resulting in a policy network which takes the states as input and gives the next optimal control action as output. Through this procedure, we are able to capture the previously believed behaviour of the biosystem. Subsequently, we adopted this network as an initial policy for the ‚Äúreal‚Äù system (the plant) and apply a batch-to-batch reinforcement learning strategy to update the network‚Äôs accuracy. This is computed by using a more complex process model (representing the real plant) embedded with adequate stochasticity to account for the perturbations in a real dynamic bioprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in a case study by computing the optimal policy in a realistic number of batch runs.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Batch Process","Recurrent Neural Networks","Bio-processes"],"title":"Reinforcement Learning for Batch-to-Batch Bioprocess Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PhD Scholarships Funding is available through a number of scholarships including:\nImperial Marshall Scholarship EPSRC DTP Studentships Becas Chile Postdoctoral and Research Associate Fellowships IX AI for Science Fellowships EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellowship Marie Sklodowska-Curie Royal Society‚Äôs Newton International Fellowship PhD Applicants We welcome applications from prospective PhD students who are interested in joining our research group.
