Depending on the effort required to develop accurate models, it might be more efficient to jump the model-building step. Instead, we can use derivative-free optimization (DFO) - also known as black-box or \u0026#39;data-driven\u0026#39; optimization - for optimal controller tuning, reactor design, experiment design, or flowsheet design based purely on input-output evaluations.

Rather than use black-box optimization to optimize physical systems or simulations, we can solve complex coordination problems where the black-box evaluations involve optimization problems themselves.

To this end, we can use DFO to determine the coordinating \u0026#39;complicating\u0026#39; variables in value chain and multi-level hierarchical planning-scheduling-control problems, otherwise determined by heuristics, decomposition techniques, or distributed optimization.

However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, we introduced the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. This concept is best illustrated visually as per the attached figures, where the performance of a controller around two possible set-points is compared: the global optimum (scenario 1 in blue) and the adversarially robust optimum (scenario 2 in red). We observe that, paradoxically, operating at the adversarially robust optimum yields a 30% larger mean objective value compared to operating at the global optimum due to its inherent robustness.

Finding synthesis pathways from potential reactants towards the molecule or product of interest is challenging. Traditionally, expert chemists use their own intuition to find potential disconnection sites in the product molecule to arrive at one or more reactant intermediates. These intermediates are subject to further inspection to finally arrive at reactants (building blocks) that can be purchased off-shelf. The iterative process from the molecular product to building blocks is formally known as retrosynthesis. To aid scientists in this endeavor, researchers have proposed a variety of computational tools based on heuristics, reaction rules, or data-driven approaches. Within recent years, machine learning (ML) has received tremendous attention for retrosynthesis. While ML algorithms are seen to be successful at proposing viable synthesis routes towards simpler molecules, there are many remaining challenges until these techniques will have a significant impact on molecular synthesis and discovery.

Recent advancements in high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning have notably improved experimental procedures. While Bayesian optimization (BO) has undeniably revolutionized the landscape of optimization in experimental design, especially in the chemical domain, it's important to recognize the role of other surrogate-based approaches within conventional chemistry optimization problems. This is particularly relevant because many chemical problems involve mixed-variable design space with physical constraints, making it challenging for conventional BO approaches to obtain feasible samples during the acquisition step while maintaining exploration capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating mixed-integer optimization strategies is one way to address these challenges effectively. Specifically, we propose the utilization of mixed-integer surrogates and acquisition functions--methods that offer inherent compatibility with problems with discrete and mixed-variable design space. This work focuses on Piecewise Affine Surrogate-based optimization (PWAS), a surrogate model capable of handling mixed-variable problems subject to linear constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in optimizing experimental planning through three case studies, each with a different design space size and numerical complexity: i) optimization of reaction conditions for Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (fully categorical), ii) optimization of crossed-barrel design to augment mechanical toughness (mixed-integer), and iii) solvent design for enhanced Menschutkin reaction kinetics (mixed-integer and categorical with linear constraints). By benchmarking PWAS against state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms and BO variants, we offer insights into the practical applicability of mixed-integer surrogates.","tags":["Bayesian optimization","Design of Experiment","MILP","mixed-variable","surrogate-based optimization"],"title":"Discrete and mixed-variable experimental design with surrogate-based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Savage","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057361,"objectID":"0bfef5819af7cdd4fa106ee3908668e8","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/savage-human-algorithm-2024-1/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:01.337168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-human-algorithm-2024-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian optimization has been successfully applied throughout Chemical Engineering for the optimization of functions that are expensive-to-evaluate, or where gradients are not easily obtainable.

To address this, in this paper, we present the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization (ARO) solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. To validate our claims, we present three case studies: an illustrative example, a bioreactor case study, and a multi-loop evaporator process. The proposed approach is found to improve RTO objectives, such as profit, by as much as $50%$ in some case studies compared to RTO formulations which ignore the performance of the control layers.","tags":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control"],"title":"ARRTOC: Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prodromos Daoutidis","Jay H.

With an emphasis on user-friendly design, we aim to streamline accessibility and facilitate utilisation within the research community. Additionally, we suggest and perform a new interpretability study to uncover the degree of chemical understanding acquired by retrosynthesis models. Our results reveal that frameworks based on chemical reaction rules yield the most diverse, chemically valid, and feasible reactions, whereas purely data-driven frameworks suffer from unfeasible and invalid predictions. The interpretability study emphasises that incorporating reaction rules not only enhances model performance but also improves interpretability. For simple molecules, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks identify relevant functional groups within the product molecule, providing thermodynamic stabilisation over the reactant precursors. In contrast, the popular Transformer fails to identify such crucial stabilisation. As the molecule and reaction mechanism grow more complex, both data-driven models propose unfeasible disconnections without offering a chemical rationale.

While many centralized solutions to the problem exist, they are not applicable to real-world supply chains made up of independent entities. The problem can however be naturally decomposed into sub-problems, each associated with an independent entity, turning it into a multi-agent system. Therefore, a decentralized data-driven solution to inventory management problems using multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed where each entity is controlled by an agent. Three multi-agent variations of the proximal policy optimization algorithm are investigated through simulations of different supply chain networks and levels of uncertainty. The centralized training decentralized execution framework is deployed, which relies on offline centralization during simulation-based policy identification, but enables decentralization when the policies are deployed online to the real system. Results show that using multi-agent proximal policy optimization with a centralized critic leads to performance very close to that of a centralized data-driven solution and outperforms a distributed model-based solution in most cases while respecting the information constraints of the system.","tags":["Computer Science - Machine Learning","Computer Science - Multiagent Systems","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control"],"title":"An Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Inventory Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengang Zhong","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057362,"objectID":"87937221221712d762d760da4bbcc928","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/zhong-efficient-2023/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:02.719893Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-efficient-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a distributionally robust data-driven model predictive control (MPC) framework for discrete-time linear systems with additive disturbances, while assuming the distribution is only partially known through samples.

As a result, mobility considerations are becoming increasingly important in energy systems planning, particularly to achieve energy access in developing countries. Advanced “Plug and Play” control strategies have been recently developed with such a decentralized framework in mind, allowing easier interconnection of nomadic communities, both to each other and to the main grid. Considering the above, the design and planning strategy of a mobile multi-energy supply system for a nomadic community is investigated in this work. Motivated by the scale and dimensionality of the associated uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables over the 30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Flexibility Analysis is implemented for the design and planning problem. DRL based solutions are benchmarked against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected performance under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in Mongolia suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the degree of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor. Additionally, the DRL based policies lead to the development of dynamic evolution and adaptability strategies, which can be used by the targeted communities under a very wide range of potential scenarios. Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such as Cost, Equivalent Emissions and Total Unmet Load are measured, suggesting potential improvements compared to available baselines of up to 25%, 67% and 76%, respectively. Finally, the decomposition of values of flexibility and plug and play operation is presented using a variation of real options theory, with important implications for both nomadic communities and policymakers focused on enabling their energy access.","tags":["Deep Reinforcement Learning","Energy Systems Design","Flexibility in Design","Mobile Micro-Grids Systems","Real Options Analysis","Uncertainty and Risk Analysis"],"title":"Design and planning of flexible mobile Micro-Grids using Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bovinille Anye Cho","José Ángel Moreno-Cabezuelo","Lauren A.

This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task owing to their nonlinear behaviour. Standard methods of dealing with nonlinear systems such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems, thus requiring an alternative approach. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear system using data generated from identification experiments. We demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wide range of conditions defined by the training dataset used. As a result of this, we show that the learned linear model can subsequently be used for the successful control of the original system. We demonstrate this by applying the proposed framework to three examples; a benchmark example from the literature, and two practical, complex nonlinear dynamical systems from the chemical engineering domain: the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) system and finally the four-tank system.","tags":["Koopman operator","Machine learning","Neural networks","Nonlinear control","Nonlinear dynamics","System identification"],"title":"Linearizing nonlinear dynamics using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haiting Wang","Cleo Kontoravdi","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057363,"objectID":"c4be3faac6f4e1bdecdfae610f73f1c3","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/wang-hybrid-2023/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:03.461548Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-hybrid-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the main hurdles in the computer-aided design and optimization of industrial bioprocesses is the limited capability of models to accurately represent biosystems.

Thus, hybrid models may represent the best of both worlds.

To address this and accelerate the design of new biochemical processes, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework recently reformulated synchronous hybrid model structure-parameter identification into a process optimal control problem.

This framework first combines possible kinetic structures from phenomenological knowledge, then simultaneously identifies the most likely hybrid model structure and time-varying parameter trajectories. To demonstrate the performance of the PINN based framework, several in-silico case studies were conducted using a known ground truth bioprocess.

When the number of gas analyzers in such CCS units is limited, variations in the load of the power plant pose a challenge to determine the gaseous CO2 concentration profile in the absorber. A dynamic hybrid model for estimating the carbon capture absorber’s gaseous CO2 concentration profile has been proposed in this study. The model is built using actual process data collected from a carbon capture pilot plant and it combines data-driven and reaction kinetic (mechanistic) modeling approaches to act as a soft sensor along the absorber column. A subset of the process data is used for training the data-driven models and for estimating the parameters of the mechanistic model respectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the data-driven model to reduce the input size and hence the size of the dynamic model elements. The outputs of the two models are fused by comparing the computed covariance matrices. A particular challenge for this work is that the collected process data has missing spatial labels and temporal values for the CO2 concentration measurements. The presented models are obtained using an encoding and interpolation approach for the missing information. For comparison, an alternative approach based on semi-supervised learning has been implemented. The performance of the resulting soft sensors is verified by using process data from previously unseen operating conditions. The soft sensor based on the proposed hybrid model outperforms the soft sensor trained by semi-supervised autoencoder. Overall the results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the CO2 concentration percentage with an average root mean squared error of 0.123.","tags":["Carbon capture pilot plant","Data-driven modeling","Long short term memory","Soft sensor"],"title":"A hybrid data-driven and mechanistic model soft sensor for estimating CO2 concentrations for a carbon capture pilot plant","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Tom Savage","Nausheen Basha","Omar Matar","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716057364,"objectID":"82ffcd0d747bddba668aed2bec929ee0","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/savage-deep-2022/","publishdate":"2024-05-18T18:36:03.971609Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-deep-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"New manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing have recently enabled the creation of previously infeasible chemical reactor designs.

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability — which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that analyse the performance of the proposed approach.","tags":["Policy search","Reinforcement Learning","Data-driven process control","Chance constraints","Bayesian Optimization"],"title":"Chance Constrained Policy Optimization for Process Control and Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Sitter","Damien van de Berg","Max Mowbray","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321131,"objectID":"df9284ef1d0fa5e9868786876c7b1932","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.354769Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has received significant attention as it promises novel and efficient solutions to complex control problems.

In the absence of gradient information or cheap-to-evaluate models, one must resort to efficient optimization routines that rely only on function evaluations. Creating a model can itself be considered part of the expensive black box optimization process. In this work, we investigate how perceived state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms address different instances of these problems in process engineering.

In this way, low fidelity samples can be obtained via a model, while high fidelity samples are obtained through measurements of the system. This framework captures the system’s behavior in a non-parametric fashion, while driving exploration through acquisition functions.

In this paper Gaussian processes are used as a method of function approximation to describe the action-value function of a non-isothermal semi-batch reactor. Through the use of analytical uncertainty obtained from Gaussian process predictions, trade off between exploration and exploitation is enabled, allowing for efficient generation of effective policies. Importantly Gaussian processes also enable probabilistic constraint violation to be modelled, ensuring safe constraint satisfaction throughout the learning procedure. On application to the in-silico case study, a safe, effective policy was generated utilising only 100 evaluations of process trajectory with no prior knowledge of the process dynamics. A result that would require significantly more trajectory evaluations when compared to a neural network based approach.","tags":["Batch Processes","Modelling","Identification","Scheduling","Optimization"],"title":"Model-free safe reinforcement learning for chemical processes using Gaussian processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bovinille Anye Cho","Miguel Ángel de Carvalho Servia","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Robin Smith","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"5f67f1325cf62c630276e7e844367a2a","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/anye-cho-synergising-2021/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:45.086688Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anye-cho-synergising-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Light attenuation is a primary challenge limiting the upscaling of photobioreactors for sustainable bio-production. One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.","tags":["biomass cultivation","culture mixing","light/dark cycle","multiscale kinetic modelling","photobioreactor design"],"title":"Synergising biomass growth kinetics and transport mechanisms to simulate light/dark cycle effects on photo-production systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Savage","Hector Fernando Almeida-Trasvina","Dr. Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona","Robin Smith","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684323406,"objectID":"5fb99e51fb2131ed1fb3542d2a849b51","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/savage-202073/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:46.430167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-202073/","section":"publication","summary":"Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques. Conventionally, this is completed by using first-principle physical models or data-driven models to replace the original rigorous models for optimization and selection of a specific unit operation. Despite its achievements, this strategy is inefficient when dealing with complex process flowsheets such as utility and refrigeration systems where a large number of unit operations are heavily connected by recycling streams. To address this problem, an integrated data-driven modelling and optimization framework is proposed in this work. The framework first constructs a hybrid machine learning based surrogate model to automatically reduce the system dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm, in specific, evolutionary algorithm, is embedded to identify the optimal solution of this surrogate model. Quality and accuracy of the estimated optimal solution is finally validated against the rigorous process model. Through an iterative approach, optimal operating conditions for the entire process flowsheet are efficiently identified. Furthermore, the novel CryoMan Cascade cycle system for large scale liquefied natural gas manufacturing is used as the case study.

The main bottleneck in the industrial application of DRTO is the presence of uncertainty. Many stochastic systems present the following obstacles: 1) plant-model mismatch, 2) process disturbances, 3) risks in violation of process constraints. To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint. The advantage and performance of this strategy are illustrated through a stochastic dynamic bioprocess optimization problem, to produce sustainable high-value bioproducts.","tags":["Reinforcement learning","Uncertain dynamic systems","Stochastic control","Chemical process control","Adaptive control","Policy gradient"],"title":"Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization under Uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Savage","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684323406,"objectID":"a8e7dbbbea4a5bea5693482394f1d2ab","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/doi-10-1021-acs-iecr-9-b-06511/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:46.30713Z","relpermalink":"/publication/doi-10-1021-acs-iecr-9-b-06511/","section":"publication","summary":" Biomass-derived polymer production processes have been extensively studied to substitute petrochemical-based polymer synthesis routes. However, previous research predominantly focused on the synthesis of nitrogen-free polymers. Therefore, a novel superstructure reaction network was constructed in this study to convert different types of biomass waste into a range of commercial nitrogen-containing polymers. Trade-offs between process profit and greenness were analyzed to screen the large size of bioderived reaction pathways. Both mixed-integer programming and multiobjective optimization were formulated to effectively identify the best polymer candidates and their associated optimal synthesis route. Several commercial nitrogen-containing polymers including urea-formaldehyde and Nylon 1,6 were found to be promising candidates for future bioproduction. Moreover, the stability of current optimization results with respect to the availability of external nitrogen and hydrogen sources was also thoroughly analyzed.

A novel CryoMan cascade liquefied natural gas (LNG) refrigeration cycle is selected as the case study which has been highlighted for potential use within industry. Given its high nonlinearity and dimensionality (31 input variables and 20 output variables with a number of physical constraints) and short time horizon for real-time decision-making, an time-efficient optimization scheme must be developed to maximize process performance. Therefore, various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques as well as surrogate model structures are explored in order to accurately capture the behaviour of this highly complex and interrelated process flowsheet. Optimal solutions identified by the surrogate models are validated against the rigorous process model. Following from the challenges encountered by artificial neural network based surrogate models, Gaussian processes were adopted and combined with partial least squares to simultaneously reduce dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Through this innovative surrogate modelling strategy, overall time to optimize the LNG production process was reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the rigorous model based optimization methodology, hence significantly facilitating the industrial application of this new process.","tags":["chemical engineering","large scale optimization problem","efficient strategies for large scale complex systems","machine learning","model reduction"],"title":"Surrogate Modelling and Optimization for Complex Liquefied Natural Gas Refrigeration Cycles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

However, bioprocesses are generally operated at unsteady-state conditions and are stochastic from a macro-scale perspective, making their optimisation a challenging task. Furthermore, as biological systems are highly complex, plant-model mismatch is usually present. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based online optimisation strategy. We first use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy given a preliminary process model. This means that we compute diverse trajectories and feed them into a recurrent neural network, resulting in a policy network which takes the states as input and gives the next optimal control action as output. Through this procedure, we are able to capture the previously believed behaviour of the biosystem. Subsequently, we adopted this network as an initial policy for the “real” system (the plant) and apply a batch-to-batch reinforcement learning strategy to update the network’s accuracy. This is computed by using a more complex process model (representing the real plant) embedded with adequate stochasticity to account for the perturbations in a real dynamic bioprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in a case study by computing the optimal policy in a realistic number of batch runs.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Batch Process","Recurrent Neural Networks","Bio-processes"],"title":"Reinforcement Learning for Batch-to-Batch Bioprocess Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PhD Applicants We welcome applications from prospective PhD students who are interested in joining our research group.
