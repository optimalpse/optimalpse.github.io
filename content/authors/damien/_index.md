bio: Final-year PhD candidate working at the intersection of optimization and Machine Learning. I investigate how data-driven techniques can aid the optimization of integrated manufacturing and supply chain systems, with a focus on black-box optimization, optimization with embedded neural networks, and Reinforcement Learning for combinatorial optimization. By collaborating with industry, I ensure my case studies are industrially relevant and that my algorithms respect the organizational and business considerations of the process industries.
